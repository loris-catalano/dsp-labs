# Film Manager Node Server

## Overview
This server was generated using the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.
The project uses an OpenAPI specification ([openapi.yaml](api/openapi.yaml)) as a blueprint to generate the server stub. 

An already defined structure was provided by the professors, and I adjusted it to fit the needs of the project.
